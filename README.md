`oaipmh-scythe` is a lightweight [OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) client library
written in Python. It has been designed for conveniently retrieving data from OAI interfaces the Pythonic way:

```python
from oaipmh_scythe import Scythe

with Scythe("https://zenodo.org/oai2d") as scythe:
  records = scythe.list_records()
  next(records)
# <Record oai:zenodo.org:4574771>
```

## Features

- Easy harvesting of OAI-compliant interfaces
- Support for all six OAI verbs
- Convenient object representations of OAI items (records, headers, sets, ...)
- Automatic de-serialization of Dublin Core-encoded metadata payloads to Python dictionaries
- Option for ignoring deleted items

## Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.10

`oaipmh-scythe` is built with:

- [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx) for issuing HTTP requests
- [lxml](https://github.com/lxml/lxml) for parsing XML responses

## Installation

You can install `oaipmh-scythe` via pip from [PyPI][pypi-url]:
