"""The response module offers a structured representation of responses from OAI-PMH services.

This module defines the OAIResponse class, which encapsulates the HTTP response from an OAI-PMH server,
providing easy access to its content both as raw text and as parsed XML. It is designed to work seamlessly
with various components of an OAI-PMH client, handling the nuances of OAI-PMH responses.
