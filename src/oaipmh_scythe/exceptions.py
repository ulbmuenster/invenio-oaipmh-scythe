"""The exceptions module defines exception classes for handling error scenarios encountered in OAI-PMH operations.

These exception classes provide a structured way to capture and communicate specific errors that may occur
while interacting with OAI-PMH services. Each class corresponds to a particular type of error defined
in the OAI-PMH protocol, facilitating precise error handling and meaningful feedback in client applications.

Classes:
    OAIPMHException: The base exception class for all OAI-PMH related errors.
    GeneralOAIPMHError: A general exception class for OAI-PMH errors not specifically covered by other classes.
    BadArgument: Raised when a request contains illegal, missing, or improperly formatted arguments.
    BadVerb: Raised when the verb argument in a request is invalid or improperly used.
    BadResumptionToken: Raised when a resumption token is invalid or expired.
    CannotDisseminateFormat: Raised when a requested metadata format is not supported.
    IdDoesNotExist: Raised when an identifier does not exist or is illegal in a repository.
    NoSetHierarchy: Raised when a repository does not support set hierarchies.
    NoMetadataFormats: Raised when no metadata formats are available for an item.
    NoRecordsMatch: Raised when a query yields no results due to specific argument combinations.

These custom exceptions enhance the robustness and clarity of error handling in OAI-PMH client implementations,
aligning closely with the protocol's standard error conditions.
